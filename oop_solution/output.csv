In August 2018[comma] members of university communities worldwide may                                    have been providing access to more than just homework assignments.                                    Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) researchers discovered a                                    URL spoofing a login page for a university. Further research into the                                    IP address hosting the spoofed page revealed a broader campaign to                                    steal credentials.
